Two halves. The first builds a small tree on disk and asserts the graph walk,
so the shapes that matter are stated outright rather than inferred from the
real tree. The second runs against the REAL repository, because the bug this
script fixes was a heuristic that looked correct and did not match the tree it
was aimed at -- a unit test over a fixture would have passed for the old code
too.
